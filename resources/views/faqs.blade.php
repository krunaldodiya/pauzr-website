                height="321" /><br /> <br /> PauzR will track the time for which the timer (20 or 40 or 60 minutes)
            inside the app was on. For successful 20 minutes, 1 point; for 40 minutes, 3 points; for 60 minutes, 5

        </ol>
        <p>In the side menu, you can click on &lsquo;Invite and Earn&rsquo; and select friends you want to invite. If
            your friend uses the link shared by you to download the app, you both will get 5 points. There is no limit

                    height="356" /> <br /> Scoreboard displays leaderboard for Today, This Week, and This Month for your
                selected city. Your rank will be displayed along with other PauzR users of your city based on the time
                the timer sessions were successfully completed. Please note, Scoreboard only takes into account the
                total time the timer session was completed by you and other users. It does not take into consideration
                how many points you have earned.</li>
            <li><strong>What is a successful timer session?</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once the timer is started in the PauzR app, user must not leave the PauzR app. However, the user can lock the
            phone. Even if user leaves the PauzR app by mistake in the middle of the session, an immediate notification
            appears asking the user to continue the session. Clicking the notification takes the user back to the timer
            screen. The buffer time for user to return back to the screen is 5 seconds.</p>
